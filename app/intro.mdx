I'm a software engineer with lots of experience building fast, fun,
accessible user-interfaces. I've worked with data-intensive
enterprise projects, startups, museums and theater companies.

Outside of work, I'm an [artist](http://zackdavis.net) and a
gardener. I live in Portland, Oregon.

I'd love to hear from you:
